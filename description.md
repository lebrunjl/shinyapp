# shinyapp

# This app shows how considering multiple variables in a regression removes coefficient bias.
# the example is taken from the dataset mtcars from the package CAR where we explain gas mileage
# with car weight alone or with car weight and acceleration and car transmission mode.
# we see that the coefficient for the weight explaining variable changes significantly
# thus reinforcing the cautionary advice to seek more than one variable in a linear regression
# in order to avoid bias.
